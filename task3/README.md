# Dashboard Performance Optimization with Web Workers

## Problem
The Dashboard component was experiencing high Total Blocking Time (TBT) due to heavy computation (1e8 iterations) running on the main thread, causing UI jank and poor user experience.

## Solution
- Implemented Web Worker to handle heavy computation in a separate thread
- Added loading state for better user feedback
- Proper worker cleanup on component unmount
- Maintained UI responsiveness during calculation

## Technical Implementation
- Created `worker.ts` for computation logic
- Updated `Dashboard.tsx` to use Web Worker
- Added TypeScript configuration for Web Worker support
- Set up Vite build system with proper worker configuration

## Performance Improvements
- Reduced Total Blocking Time (TBT)
- Improved First Input Delay (FID)
- Better Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics
- Enhanced Core Web Vitals scores

## Testing
- Verified UI remains responsive during calculation
- Confirmed worker cleanup on component unmount
- Tested loading state transitions

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run development server: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`
